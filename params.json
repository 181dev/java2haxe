This utility does the job vice versa: java2haxe converts Java source to Haxe source using a modified\r\nversion of Sharpen, a Java to C# converter. This way you can automate your translating of Java source codes to the Haxe platform. \r\n\r\n# Project Contents\r\n## sharpen.core\r\nThis eclipse project contains a modified version of Sharpen. \r\n\r\n## sharpen.jgit\r\nThis directory contains an example usage of Sharpen to convert Java to Haxe source. \r\nAs an example it converts the JGit source to Haxe. The build file is based on the \r\nmake file of NGit. \r\n\r\n## sharpen.haxe.test\r\nThis eclipse project contains a very basic usage of this utility. It is used for testing small code conversion parts and demonstrating usage and supported features. \r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n1. Import the Eclipse projects to your workspace\r\n2. Export the sharpen.core project (Deployable plug-ins and fragments) to your Eclipse home directory \r\n3. Adjust the paths in the sharpen.jgit/build.xml to match your system.\r\n4. Run the build.xml using ant (pull target)\r\n5. The Haxe source can be found in the generated directory. \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1. Copy the dist/sharpen.core.jar to your Eclipse\\Plugins directory\r\n2. Adjust the paths in the sharpen.jgit/build.xml to match your system.\r\n3. Run the build.xml using ant (pull target)\r\n4. The Haxe source can be found in the generated directory. \r\n\r\n# Links\r\n* Sharpen - http://community.versant.com/Documentation/Reference/db4o-7.12/java/reference/html/Content/sharpen.html\r\n* JGit - http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\r\n* NGit - https://github.com/mono/ngit"}
