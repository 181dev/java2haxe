# About
This small command-line utility allows the conversion of a XMI file created
by MoDisco to Haxe source. Simply convert any Java project to a XMI file using
the MoDisco plugin and run this converter to get Haxe source.

NOTE: This project is still work in progress and not usable yet. Feel free to contribute.
